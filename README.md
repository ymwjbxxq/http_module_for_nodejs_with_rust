# Build a native module for NodeJs with Rust

## What is Neon

[Neon](https://neon-bindings.com/) is a library and toolchain for embedding Rust in your Node.js apps and libraries. Neon allows you to write type-safe and memory-safe, crash-free native Node modules, guaranteeing Rustâ€™s parallelism with thread safety.

Neon has a few types https://neon-bindings.com/docs/primitive-types:

* JsValue
* subject
* And primitives like JsNumber

The key is to map your JS input to Rust and return an output mapping Rust to JS.


## How

The basic hello world is like this
```Rust
#[neon::main]
fn main(mut cx: ModuleContext) -> NeonResult<()> {
    cx.export_function("hello", hello)?;
    Ok(())
}
fn hello(mut cx: FunctionContext) -> JsResult<JsString> {
    Ok(cx.string("hello node"))
}
```
And you can call from JS point to the export_function key.

```node
node
> require('.').hello()
hello node
```

While you will find just hello world or Fibonacci examples, I tried to do something more tangible. I tried to implement an HTTP client with [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest)

## How to Run

Change the URL that you want to HIT inside index.ts

1. npm install
2. build the native module under native folder running cargo build --release
3. from the root compile TypeScript with tsc
4. node index.js

You should be able to see something like this with 100 requests.
Results are from my machine so it could change based on your computer settings.

```bash
START native 2021-12-08T15:37:13.670Z
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
END*********441
START node-fetch 2021-12-08T15:37:15.213Z
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
{ message: 'Go ahead without me' }
END*********524ms
```

The results are always different sometimes. Native is slower, sometimes faster, but the point here is not which one is faster but that we can integrate the power of Rust in our javascript application.

Thanks to the Neon members for the support to point out the problems.
They even add an example https://github.com/neon-bindings/examples/pull/82.
